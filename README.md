# 🚀 Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

## 📌 Introduction
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a class of deep learning models widely used for image recognition, object detection, and other visual tasks.

## 🔍 How CNNs Work
A CNN consists of multiple layers that extract and process image features. The key layers include:
