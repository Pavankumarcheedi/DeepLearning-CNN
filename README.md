### **Neural Network Architecture** 🧠  

The image represents a **basic neural network** with three key layers:  

1️⃣ **Input Layer** – Receives raw data (e.g., images, text, numbers). Each neuron represents an input feature.  

2️⃣ **Hidden Layers** – Extract patterns using mathematical transformations. More layers = **deeper network**.  

3️⃣ **Output Layer** – Produces final predictions.  
   - **Regression**: Single neuron (continuous value).  
   - **Binary Classification**: One neuron (sigmoid activation).  
   - **Multi-class Classification**: Multiple neurons (softmax activation).  

🔹 **Fully Connected Network (FCN)** – Every neuron in a layer connects to every neuron in the next.  
  


# 🚀 Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

## 📌 Introduction
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a class of deep learning models widely used for image recognition, object detection, and other visual tasks.

## 🔍 How CNNs Work
A CNN consists of multiple layers that extract and process image features. The key layers include:


### 🖼 CNN Process: From Input Image to Classification

This diagram illustrates how a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) processes an input image, extracts features, and classifies it into a category.

### **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Pipeline** 🖼️🔍  

A CNN processes images in **five main steps**:  

1️⃣ **Input Image** – The raw image is represented as a matrix of pixel values.  
2️⃣ **Filters** – Small matrices slide over the input to detect features (edges, textures).  
3️⃣ **Convolution Layers** – Apply filters to extract complex patterns.  
4️⃣ **Pooling** – Reduces dimensionality while keeping important features.  
5️⃣ **Feed-Forward Layer** – Final classification using a fully connected neural network.  

🔹 CNNs excel in **image recognition, object detection, and pattern analysis**
